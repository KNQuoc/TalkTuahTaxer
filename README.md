Traditional budgeting apps? Too passive. Sheer willpower? Let’s be real. That’s where TalkTuahTaxer steps in.
It’s your no-nonsense spending buddy, ready to call you out before you hit Confirm Purchase and help you think twice about that “essential” fifth pair of headphones.

## What It Does
**TalkTuahTaxer** is a Chrome extension designed to help you control your online spending. Whenever you're on Amazon checkout page, it locks the *BUY NOW* button and throws you into a scary-basement-style scenario! Two influencers will argue your purchase:
- **Kai Cenat**: Explains how buying this will give you negative aura and why you should not buy the item
- **Livvy Dunne**: Lure you into buying the item by stating how it can help you.
